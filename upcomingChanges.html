				<p class="name2">Mediterranean</p>
					<p class="info2"><span class="buff">New rule</span> <span class="dark">Distance to main water body between players is &#177;5 tiles</span> </p>
					<p class="comment">
						Getting access to fish is highly important.<br>
						To contest the main water players had to build multiple dock, the further way a player was from the water the more economy damage the dock building caused.<br>
						Teams/players with shorter distance to main water were in such a big advantage with no counter play possible form the opposed team.<br>
						Rivers count as main water body.<br>
					</p>
					
				<br><p class="name2">Small Islands</p>
					<p class="info2"><span class="buff">New rule</span> <span class="dark"> Spawn non player islands, 1-6 depending on map size</span> (Spawns forest in each island)</p>
					<p class="comment">
						Small islands were easy to defend from rushes, often games were decided by the wood amount on each island. Team with more wood was almost always the winner because they could muster bigger water army.<br>
						Now even a small victory in water control can be transformed into economical advantage.
					</p>

				<br><p class="name2">Inland</p>
					<p class="info2"><span class="nerf">Variant removed</span> <span class="dark">Rivers</span> </p>
					<p class="comment">
						Inlands biggest economy advantage came from the deep sea fish patches.<br>
						The team with better access to deep sea fish was in a big advantage.<br>
						In river variants the game was easier to delay giving the player with a deep sea access much stronger Iron Age than a player without deep sea could ever get.<br>
						Even if the deep sea fish was evenly spread between teams it still wouldn't be great because the players without deep sea would not be as big of a factor in winning the game as the players with deep sea access were, causing these matches to feel like these player had too little control over the teams fate.<br>
						With no rivers; Tool Age aggression was always an option, giving the player with no good water access an ability to punish greedy plays, and they could also easier travel long distances to build the docks making it possible for them to also boom on water.
					</p>
				
				<br><p class="name2">Narrows, Continental</p>
					<p class="info2"><span class="buff">Maximum distance to closest forest</span> <span class="removed"> ? tiles</span> -&gt; <span class="dark">15 tiles</span> </p>
					<p class="comment">
						Having to travel long distance for the closest forest was already big economical hit.<br>
						And in top of that defending the base was much harder because your economy was so scattered, making these starts all around weaker with no upsides at all.

				<p class="explanation2">
					All civilizations will have two unique heroes, one at Bronze Age, and one at Iron Age.<br>
					These heroes will spawn from Town Center after researching into the age.<br>
					-Heroes can only be converted after researching monotheism.<br>
					-Heroes are twice as resistant to conversion.<br><br>
					Bronze Age heroes have a power of one Bronze Age unit or slightly bit stronger than that.<br>
					Iron Age Units are much stronger than a basic unit.

			</div>			<div class="piece">
				<p class="explanation2">
					Having extra staring resource on AI made defensive play styles the only viable options.<br>
					Now players can also play offensive.<br>
					This way the AI is closer to real human player where dealing economy damage early on will cause them to significantly slow down. <br>
					AI was slow to advance because it built the barrack too early into the game.
